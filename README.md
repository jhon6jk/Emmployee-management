# Employee Management System

A robust Java/Spring Boot-based application paired with a React UI — designed for managing employee data, attendance, salaries, and more.

---

## Project Structure

- `backend/` – Spring Boot REST API (handles employees, departments, payroll, leave management).
- `ui/` – React frontend (user-friendly dashboard and interactive UI components).

---

## Features

- CRUD operations for employee profiles.
- Track attendance, manage leaves, and generate salary reports.
- User authentication (consider JWT or session-based security).
- Responsive and modern UI developed with React.
- Clean separation of frontend and backend logic.

---

## Prerequisites

You’ll need to install:

- Java 11+ & Maven
- Node.js & npm (or yarn)
- A running database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)

---

## Getting Started

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
mvn clean install
java -jar target/employee-management-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

# Frontend (in a new terminal)
cd ui
npm install
npm start
```

- Backend server runs on: http://localhost:8080  
- React app runs on: http://localhost:3000

---

## Configuration

- Backend: Configure `application.properties` with DB credentials, ports, etc.
- Frontend: Set API base URL in `.env` file:
  ```
  REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
  ```

---

## Testing

- Backend tests (JUnit): `mvn test`
- Frontend tests (Jest/RTL): `npm test`

---

## Docker (Optional)

Both frontend and backend can be containerized. Add `Dockerfile` in each and use a `docker-compose.yml` to orchestrate.

---
